Birthday wisher is next project that indroduced me to datetime and smtplib libraries.
The project was made 95% by myself. I was given only csv and txt files and told: "just do it".
In addition to this project i have 3 "letter.txt" files and ofe "birthdays.csv" file.
I didn't add this to github because of personal informations :)
