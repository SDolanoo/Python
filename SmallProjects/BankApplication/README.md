This is my project of simple console bank application.
The goal was mainly to train file handling.

The goal in the near future will be make this app with OOP.

Known issues:
-Program is not prepared for user providing wrong data types.
-Saving user changes in .txt file will overwrite whole file which is not optimal, but making big database for many users was not a goal.
